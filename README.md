# BusesAreUs

This app maps the location of stops, buses and bus routes on the Greater Vancouver Transit system (Translink) and retrieves real time arrival information at those stops. It also plots the user's location on the map and highlights the nearest bus stop. To do this, the app makes use of TransLink Open API - a service that is provided free of charge.
