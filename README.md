Term Project for CPSC 210 - Software Construction.

This app maps the location of stops, buses and bus routes on the Greater Vancouver Transit system (Translink) and retrieves real time arrival information at those stops. It also plots the user's location on the map and highlights the nearest bus stop. To do this, the app makes use of TransLink Open API - a service that is provided free of charge.

Learning Goals from project page:

- given the specification of a data abstraction and a UML class design diagram:
	- test the abstraction using jUnit
	- implement the abstraction
	
-read the documentation for and use an Application Programming Interface (API) that has not been seen previously in the course
-test and implement an application that consumes data in JSON format provided by an online service
-configure a machine to allow for development of an Android application using device emulators
-complete the implementation of an Android application that uses a mapping API to present information to the user

Most of the code was written by course staff.
